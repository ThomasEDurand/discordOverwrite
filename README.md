# discordOverwrite
Overwrite all of your discord messages in a server

SELF SCRIPTING IS A VIOLATION OF DISCORD POLICY, USE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION

This is a script to overwrite all messages in a server with random messages. To use update the g_id and token fields in the main fucntion. 
token can be found by opening console then looking at a sucessful post request. The token is found under headers > request headers > authorization

Paste the script into your console and watch it overwrite all your messages, this will take a while as discord places limits on editing many messages in sucession.

(I plan on adding a function to get all guild_ids so this can be done on all servers in one pass)
